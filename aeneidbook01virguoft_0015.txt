Minor Poems‘. The following Minor Poems have been
ascribed to virgil, but nearly all of them on very insuffi-
cient evidence :—

(1) Culex, the story of a shepherd saved from a. snake by the
sting of a. gnat which he killed. This is probably spurious.

(2) Giris, the myth of Scylla and Nisus. Internal evidence
shows that Virgil never wrote this. Some attribute it to Gallus.

(3) Priapeia. We may be almost sure that Vix-gil never put,
his hand into such filth.

(4) M'oretum is a fragment. It begins the description of the
dailydife of a fai-mer. It may be Virgil's.

(5) Copa, an invitation <if a bar-maid to travellers to come in
and enjoy themselves. Possibly Virgil'e.

(6) Gatalecta are shorter pieces of various kinds‚some of which
seem to be Virgilian.

The Great Poems of virgil are :—

(1) The “Bucolies,” or “EclogueS‚” written between 41 and
37 B.C-.

(Q) The “ Georgics‚” written between 36 and 29.

(3) The “ AEneid‚’¹ written between 29 and 19.

The Bucomos.—The term Bucolica is from the Greek
βουκολὲω, “ to tend cattle.'' Bucolic poenis, therefore, are
poems on the tending of lierdS‚-—past‹)ral poems‚—poems
in which the speakers are shepherds or husbandmen.
The other term applied to these poenis, “Eclogues‚'' is
from the Greek ἐκλογή, “ a collection.'' On account of an
incorrect etymology some lia-ve written the word “AEg-
logue‚'' deriving it from two Greek words meaning “the
tales of goats or goat—herds.'' It is uncertain how these
poems received the name Eclogues. (a) Some say they
received this name because they are imitatione of passages
