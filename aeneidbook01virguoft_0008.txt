iv. PREFATORY xo'rns.

First Book of the AEneid is to be the field of study in Latin
poetry. Heyne’s remark regarding verse. 630 of this book

may be employed with reference to the whole book. He says
that any youth who does not dwell on this verse with delight
should be straightwayprevented from reading the poet. well,
any youth who has risen from the perusal of The Landing in

Africa without emotion aud profit must be made of very
common clay, or the master who has guided his studies must
himself have stumbled into au alien vooation.

Little need be said of the present edition. The text, with
few exceptions, follows R-ibbeck’s of 1872. Such forms as
volnus, conjunx, conubium, inlidit, hiemps, rolgyus, succepit,
‘ro tus, J uppiter, adloquitur, dicione, adglnovit, umectat, umeros,
obstipuit, Divom, temptat, may seem strange at first sight, but
Ribbeck's orthography in the main is supported by all recent
investigations in philology, and at whatever eost it is well
to discard traditional spelling when it is clearly shewn to be

baselliilstsetymology, the present standard authority, Harper’s

Latin Dictionary (Andrews’s Freund) has been closely followed.

In the preparation of the notes the editor has freely con.
sulted all the best modern editions of virgil. The works of
Conington, Kennedy, Goeenough, and Frieze have been of
most service. Due acknowledgement, it is believed, has been
given throughout the notes to these and other editors.

The present edition contains no references to standard ,
grammars—(l) because such references would have unduly
lengthened the notes ; (2) because so many different grammat-3
are employed in our schools ; (3) because it is a moot' point
with many masters whether the giving of such assistance is a
substantial aid to the young student.
