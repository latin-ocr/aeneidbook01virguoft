THI'. DACTYLIC HEXAM'ETER.

The Dactylic Heaeamcter or Heroio Verae consists ofDaetyls
(-— ψ v) or their metrica] equivalents, Spondees (—- —). The
ictus is on the first syllable of each foot. Eaeh verse eonsisfis of
six feet. The variations of the scale are :—

Ι l t Ι ι

—vv Ι —vv -νν —vv

Ι
ν

 

Ι-νν

Sometimes we find a spondee in the fifth place. The verse is
then called spondaic. (See AEneid I.‚ 617).

The ending of a word within a foeta produces a cassura. The
principal pause in a verse is called the coesuralpause. There
are sometimes two caesural pauses. The favorisse place for the
caesural pause is after the arsis or in the thesis of the third foot.
When this pause is in the fourth 100ss there is usually another
pause in the second foot. When the pause follows the fourth
soon it is called the bucolic caesura, from its prevalence in
pastoral poems. When a caesura comes after the first} syllable of
a foot ἢ is called the masculine or stronq ; when aiter tho second
syllable, the feminine or weak. The eaesural pause is usually
marked in scansion by ΙΙ , For metrica] terms see Section X.

To aid the tiro, the scansion of the first seven verses of AEneid
Ι. is given in full :
