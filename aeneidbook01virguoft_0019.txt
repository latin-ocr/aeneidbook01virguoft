Many other special effecte are produced by a dest hand-
ling of the meti-es.

Pope and others think that Virgss had a politica] object
in writing the AEneid. It is said that the primary object
of the poem was to glorify Caesar3 its secondary object, to
flatter the vanity of the Romans by the splendor and
antiquity of their origin. With this view we may regard
AEneas as typifying Augustus ; Dido, Cleopatra5 Tunius,
Antony.

Many critics have disparaged the AEneid. Its principa}
defect, if defect it may be called, is want cf originality.
Then it wants unity of construction. The hero, moreover,
is not entirely satisfactory. In the war with Turnus,
AEneas at times loses our sympathy, and Turnus excites a
superior interest. The historian‚ Niebuhr, entertains a
very low opinion of Virgil. He places him in the second
rank of Roman poets. He denies his fertility of genius
and inventive powers. He says the AEneid is a complete
failure, an unhappy idea from beginning to end. He says
that an Epic poem should be a narrative of events known
and interesting to the mass of a nation. He blames
virgil for mixing Italian traditions with Greek legends.
Virgil is nobly vindicated in the extracts quoted below
from several modern Virgilian scholare.
