the Roman emp'ire. This book closes with the famous
panegyric on Marcellus: In these six books the adveu-
tures of Ulysses as described in the Odyssey are always
before the poet's eye. This half of the poem is far supe-
rior to the other.

Here it may be said that the critics have discovered an
anachronismi in the visit of AEneas to Oarthage. Chrono-
logers place the destruction of Troy in 1184, BC.
Carthage was not founded until several centur-ies after-
wards.

The last six books of ’ the AEneid contain the history of ⁴
the struggles of [Eneas in Italy. This part of the poem
has for its model the battles of the Iliad. Latinus offers
in marriage to AEneas his daughter Lavinia, who had
already been betrothed to Turnus, king of the Rutuli.
The confliot between the heroes is terminated by the death
of Turnus, who is slain by AEneas,

The AEneid was begun when Augustus was in Spain, and
probably at the instigation of the emperor himself. Virgil
did not live to complete the revision of his poem. In his
will he requested his friends, Varius and Tucca, to improve
the poem or to burn it. In hia last hours he desired tho
manuscript to be destroyed. Augustus, after Virgil‘s
death, instructed the executors to publish the work with-
out interpolations. They transposed the second and
third books, and omitted IL, 567—588. The fact that
the AEneid was not thoropghly revised by the poet may
account for the many incomplete lines in the poem.

Virgil is very skilful in. imitative harmony. ,Recurring
dactyls express speed :—
