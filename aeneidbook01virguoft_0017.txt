of AEneas in the first book are almost translatifms from
the fifth book of the Odyssey. Virgil’s Necyia is copied
from the same poem. His similes are Homeric. His bat-
tles owe all their life to the Homeric poems. Virgil bor-
rowed many of his best thoughts from other Greek poems.
Throughout the AEneid there are many translations from
Greek tragedy. Much of the second book is derived from
two Cyclic poems : The Saok of Troy and the Little Iliad.
Euphorion furnished him with the legend of Laocoon.
The chlic νοστοῑ supplied ideas for the third book. In
the fourth book Virgil bori‘owed from the Argonautica of
Apollonius Rhodius of Alexandria. virgil owes much too

Pacuvius, Attius, Naevius, Lucilius, Lucretius„ Catullus,
Varius.

The AEneid consists of twelve books and embraces a
period of eight years. In the first book AEneas is driven
by a storm to the coast of Africa, where he is received by
Dido, queen of Carthage. In the second and third books
AEneas tells Dido the sad story of the fall of Troy and of

attachment-of Dido for AEneaS‚ of the departure of AEneas
in obedience to the commands of the gods, of the catas-
trophe of Dido's death by her own hand. The fifth book

book AEneas reaches Italy ; visits the Sibyl of Oumae ; de-
scends to the infernal regions, where he sees his father,
Anchises, and has unfolded to him the coming glory οἱ
