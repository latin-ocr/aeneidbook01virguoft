ι Epoch Primer of English History.

By Rssv M. Cssmemos, M. A.‚ Late Fellow and Tutor οἰ Merton College,
Qxford.

Authorized by the Education Department for use in Public school&
and {02 admission to the High Schools of OntariO.

Its adaptability to Public School use over all other School Histories will
be shown by the fact that—

In a brief compass of one hundred and eighty pagos it covers all the
work required for pupils preparing for entrance to nigh Schools.

The price is less than one-halt that of tls-e other authorized histories.

In using the other Historias, pupils are compelled to read nearly three
times as much in order to secure the same results.

Cteighton's Epoch Primer has been adopted by the Toronto school
Board, and many of the principa] Public Schools in Ontario.
