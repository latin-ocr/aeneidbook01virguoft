lO INTRODU OTION.

classic soenes on which his mental eye had so often gazed
with rapture. He proceeded uo sarther than Athens. There
he met Augustus, who was returning from Samos. They
both came back to ltaly together. Virgil became very ill
ou the way, and (lied soon after his arrival at Brundisium,
Ro. 19. He was buried. near Naples. A monument is
still shown which is said to be the tomb of the poet. It
is alleged that the epitaph on the tomb was written by
virgil himself :—

Mantua me genuit 3 Calabri rapuere 3 tenet nunc

Ἰ, Parthenope. Cet-ini pascua, rura, duces.

HIS APPEARANOE, CHARAOTER AND TEMPERAMENT.

Virgil is said to have been of tall stature, of delicate
frame, of dark complexion, of features far from handsome.

Iu character he was unselfish, aniiable and kind-hearted.
‘⁴ To relieve the wretched was his pride.’' In a profligate
age he was irreproachable and pure,—so pure that the
N eapolitans called him Parthenias (from πάρθενος, a virgin).
His own ability he underrated. So little did he esteem
his greatest work, the AEneid, that, before his death, he
requested his exeeutors to burn the manuscripts. He
was religious while many of his countrymen were curious
sceptics or rank infidels.

He was modest in the company of friends and diffident
among strangers. He was of a pensive and melancholy
disposition, but he never became splenetic and eynical.

HIS WORKS.

Virgil’s earliest attempt is said to ha've been an historic
poem, Res Romanae, after the manner of Ennius. He
found the subject too vast and the difficulties too many.
