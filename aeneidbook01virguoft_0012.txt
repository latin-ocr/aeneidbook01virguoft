Bithynia. In Rome he studied under the rhetorician
Epidius, and under Syro the Epicurean, an aecomplished

THE MANTUAN EPOCH. ’

Virgil spent the years 48 to 40 B. O. on his paterna]
estate at Mantua. His time was taken up with the cul-
tivation Of his farm, with his literary studies and with
the composition of his minor poems. Os his farm he was
deprived in 42 Β. O. after the battle of Philippi. The
veterans of Octavian, 011 returning from the East‚ were
rewarded for their services by ailotlnents of land in those
districts of Italy that had espoused the cause of Brutus
The neighborhood of Cremona was one of the confiscated
districts. Mantua suffered on account of its nearness to
Cremona. (See Eoi, ix. 18.‚ Mantua vae miserae nimium
vicina Cremonae). The poet’s farm was seized by a vet-
eran named Claudius. Asinius Pollio,who was the governe:
of Transpadane Gaul, was a man of literary tastes. He
took the poet under his protection for a time. When
Ρο1110, however, next year, went to the assistance of L.
Antonius in the Perusian war, virgil was compelled to
flee for his life. H e visited Rome and gained an introduc-
tion to Maecenas, the great patron of Augustali literature.
By Maecenas the poet was introduced to the notice of
Octavian. After long celay he recovered the possession
of his Mantuan estate.
