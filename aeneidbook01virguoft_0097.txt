NOTES. 93

commonly thought that the poet here refers to paintz'nqs. Some
editors, however, suppose that the representations are in sculp-

ture.
465. Flumine largo, ‘with a copious flood of ‘neers’

466-8. Namque eto„ ‘ for he saw how llere the warrior Greeks
were fieeing around Troy; how the Trojan youth pressed upon
them: how there the Trojans were fleeing 3 how the crested
Achilles in his ehariot pursued.’

Perqama : the citadel of Troy for the whole city.

Hac : adverbia] ablative.

Curru: abl. of place or of means.

Fuyer'ent, premeret, instaret .· the subjunctive of the sio-called
indii-eet question.

In the passage before us there are seven representatione :—

(1) A contest between the Greeks and Trojans with ¹victory
alternating.

(2) The death of Rhesus.

(3) The death of Troilus.

(4) The matrone of Troy. before the statue of Minerva.

(5) Priam ransoming the dead body of Hector.

(6) 'Phe battle of Memnon.

(7) The contest between the Amazons and the Greeks.

These soenes are suggested to the poet by passages in the
Iliad and the Cyolio Poems.

469. Rhesi = the story is that Rhesus, a. king of Thrace, came
to Troy as an aliy of Priam with the promise of au oraclo, that if
his steeds should taste the pasturage of Troy or drink the waters
of the Xanthus, Troy would be impregnable. On the night of
his arrival Ulysses and Diomed slew him while asleep and took
his horses to the Grecian camp.

camped in huts made of turs and twigs.
